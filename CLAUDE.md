# CLAUDE.md — Dental Wisdom website

## What this is
Static marketing site for Dental Wisdom (dentalwisdom.org): the 2027 conference (flagship), Dental Wisdom Live monthly CE, partner Deals, plus supporting pages. All requirements and exact copy live in `SITE_SPEC.md` — read it before any work. Exact copy in the spec is final: never rewrite it, only format it. Anything missing gets a visible placeholder plus `<!-- TODO: ... -->`.

**All 16 pages + 404 are built.** The site is in maintenance/content-update mode — no new pages planned currently. `giving.html` is deferred; it lives in `_archive/` only.

**Tooth Memory game (July 2026):** A Simon-style dental memory mini-game lives on TWO pages — the bottom of `404.html` and its own page `toothmemorygame/index.html` (URL `dentalwisdom.org/toothmemorygame`; the CamelCase `/ToothMemoryGame` also works because the 404 case-insensitive redirect lowercases it). The game's code is SHARED in `css/toothmemory.css` and `js/toothmemory.js` (loaded by both pages) — edit those files, not one page, and the change applies to both. Each page only holds the `.tm` section markup inline. The 112 dentist jokes and all game logic are in `js/toothmemory.js`. Share button points at `dentalwisdom.org/toothmemorygame`. Best score is saved to the visitor's own browser (localStorage). HUD has sound (🔊), new-game/reset (↺), and a colorblind-friendly numbers toggle (🔢, faint 1–9 on the teeth) — the HUD buttons are per-page markup, so add new ones to BOTH pages. Bump `?v=` on the two asset links in both pages when editing them (currently css `?v=4`, js `?v=2`).

**Agenda & Speakers pages are LIVE, full versions (as of July 30, 2026):** the earlier "coming soon" teaser note is obsolete. `conference-agenda/index.html` loads `js/agenda-data.js` + `js/agenda.js` and renders the full day-by-day schedule; `conference-speakers/index.html` renders the full speaker grid inline. Edit the live files directly — agenda content in `js/agenda-data.js`, speaker cards inline in `conference-speakers/index.html`. The `_archive/conference-agenda-full.html` / `_archive/conference-speakers-full.html` copies are now just historical backups, NOT the source of truth.

**Gobbie Cohn temporarily hidden (July 28, 2026):** Ben asked to hide Gobbie Cohn's name because his attendance is unconfirmed — restore when Ben says he's coming. Two spots, both marked with dated "HIDDEN"/"restore when he tells us" comments: (1) `js/agenda-data.js` Friday 6:15 PM line — `speaker` set to `""`, session line + APEX/CG sponsor credit kept (Ben's call); to restore, put back `speaker: "Gobbie Cohn", speakerUrl: "/conference-speakers#speaker-gobbie-cohn"`. (2) `_archive/conference-speakers-full.html` — his whole speaker card is wrapped in an HTML comment (`CARD HIDDEN 2026-07-28` … `END HIDDEN 2026-07-28 (Gobbie Cohn)`); to restore, delete those two comment lines. Nothing was deleted.

## Current live state (snapshot — updated September 8, 2026)
Quick reference for what's actually published on the live pages right now. Update this whenever speakers/sponsors/agenda change.

**Speakers live on `conference-speakers/index.html` (13 active cards, chronological):**
- Thursday: Dr. Harold Katz (TheraBreath), Dr. Daniel Greenbaum (TruAbutment), Dr. Tzvi Krupka, Dr. Ariel Steinberger, Dr. Marc Faber.
- Friday: Dr. Nathaniel Dancykier (2 sessions — Fri 9:00 AM + Shabbos 2:45 PM DVI), Dr. Sara Werb, Dr. Craig Berry, Dr. Sam Glick (orthobrain), Dr. Elaine Bylis, Rabbi Dr. Ephraim Rudolph (Fri 10:30 PM Oneg & Shiur, Crown Catapult).
- Shabbos: Sam Waller (LiveWell Capital), Rabbi Dr. David J. Katz (Touro).
- Hidden (unconfirmed, restore when Ben says): Gobbie Cohn. Archived in-file (commented, not deleted): Dr. Sean Ference, Yaakov Citron, Dr. Samuel Schuster.

**Agenda slots still marked TBD / "To Be Announced Soon" (in `js/agenda-data.js`):**
- Friday 3:00–5:00 PM concurrent block: "Complications in Perio Anterior Cases" — speaker TBD (Adin-sponsored). The other 3 tracks (Glick/orthobrain, Bylis, Werb) are filled.
- Friday 6:15 PM Mincha/Kabbalas Shabbos — Gobbie Cohn's name hidden (unconfirmed); APEX + CG Insurance sponsor credit kept.
- Shabbos 8:15 AM Pre-Davening Shiur — no speaker. Shabbos 11:00 AM Kiddush & Dvar Torah — no speaker. Shabbos 3:45 PM "Dental Related Shiur to Be Announced Soon."

**Sponsors live on `conference-sponsors` + the agenda strip (`js/sponsors-data.js`):**
- Platinum: orthobrain (shown as "Turnkey Orthodontics"), Touro College of Dental Medicine, Emerald Dental Lab, LiveWell Capital, Crown Catapult.
- Gold: MB Precious Metals, Crazy Dental, Reach, Adin, APEX, Straumann — plus Pearl and Lasso MD (both "Past Sponsor").
- Silver: The Altair Hotel, TheraBreath — plus Ultradent, Blue Sky Bio (both "Past Sponsor") and TruAbutment (pending).
- Bronze: Citron Films, Pizza Biza, CG Insurance Group — plus Pul Dental, Wonderful Dental, Zolli Candy (all "Past Sponsor").
- Removed / archived (commented in-file, not deleted): Nobel Biocare, Dental Processing Solutions, NuSmile, AAFE.
- `attending: true` sponsors get the gold "✓ Attending" pill; `pastSponsor: true` get a gray "Past Sponsor" pill and stay off the homepage logo strip.

**Conference pricing (Sept 8, 2026):**
- **Early bird now runs through September 30, 2026**, extended from August 31. Live in 4 places: homepage hero, homepage gold pricing box, homepage "Conference Fees — Dentists" accordion, and the FAQ page's closing CTA band.
- Prices unchanged, and **were never actually raised on September 1** — the deadline lapsed on paper only, so nobody was charged more and nothing needed refunding.
- The FAQ cost answer now names the date directly ("These are early bird rates, held through September 30, 2026") instead of only warning about dynamic pricing.
- **Open question for Ben: is Sept 30 a date he will hold?** "Extended" is a one-time card — a second extension teaches the list that the deadlines are decorative. If it may move again, use a plain date with no "extended".

**Dental Wisdom Live (Sept 8, 2026):**
- Aug 27, 2026 (Pearl / Dr. Mitchell Rubinstein) is `status: "past"` and carries the **Get Recording** button.
- **Oct 15, 2026 (Crown Catapult / Saul Kaplan) is the only upcoming session.**

**Shabbos meals:** the FAQ now says sign-up details **will be announced after Sukkos**, replacing a stale line promising the link "5–6 months before the conference" — a window that had already arrived.

**Sponsors:** 18 current (24 entries, 6 marked Past Sponsor). The FAQ answer no longer says sponsors "may support" the event; that wording predated any signing.


## Open follow-ups
- **Once the full agenda is finalized AND all speaker cards are done** (all "Speaker TBD" / "Lecture Title TBD" slots in `js/agenda-data.js` filled in, all ~16 speaker cards added to `conference-speakers/index.html`), revisit every line on the site that still reads as "lineup pending" — they'll be stale once the roster is final:
  - ~~`conference-speakers/index.html` — the italic line below the speaker grid: "Additional speakers to be announced."~~ DONE July 24, 2026: replaced with a schedule-change disclaimer (same disclaimer also added to the bottom of the agenda in _archive/conference-agenda-full.html).
  - `conference-faq/index.html`, "Who is lecturing and what classes will be offered?" answer — says speakers are "actively curating" and that "a full list of lectures and class topics will be published closer to the event"
  - `conference-faq/index.html`, "What is the daily schedule?" answer — says "the schedule below is tentative" and "the final schedule will be published closer to the event"
  - Re-grep the whole site for "to be announced", "TBD", "actively curating", and "published closer to the event" before closing this out, in case other pages pick up similar language later.
  - **[Done Sept 8, 2026: both conference-faq answers above have already been rewritten. The page now says only "A few sessions are still being confirmed and may be added closer to the event," which is accurate. A full-site grep confirms nothing still says "actively curating" or "the schedule below is tentative."]**
- **The live slides deck (`liveslides/index.html`) still holds the August 27 content** — Alphaeon spotlight, Pearl lecture, August giveaways — and its pink urgency bar still reads *"Hotel rates go up next week"*, written in late August and now simply wrong. Ben's call to leave it (the deck isn't linked or searchable) and rebuild before **Oct 15**. When rebuilding: either set `alert: ""` to hide the bar, or use **the hotel's real rate-increase date**. Do NOT reuse the Sept 30 early bird date there — that bar is about The Altair's room rates, a different deadline. Archive the outgoing `spotlight` / `lecture` / `giveaways` values first, per the standing rule.
- **The `$175` / `DentalWisdomLive` discount code appears only on the slides deck**, nowhere on the website, so the deck and the registration page imply different effective prices. Ben has said to leave it — noted here so it isn't mistaken for an oversight. *Still unanswered: is that code live, and does it stack on early bird?*
- **"Can I attend without staying at the host hotel?" never answers its own question.** The FAQ replies "We strongly recommend staying at The Altair…", which is a nudge, not a yes or no. Needs a policy decision from Ben before the wording is touched.
- **Hotel room rates (~$400 / $600 / $950) appear on BOTH the homepage and the FAQ.** If The Altair raises rates, both places must be updated together.
- `_archive/superseded-js/` was created Sept 8, 2026 to hold a safety copy of `js/live.js` from before the Get Recording work — archived, not deleted, per the standing rule.


## Who you're working with
Ben is the sole editor and not a developer. Explain any manual step he must take (publishing a Google Sheet, swapping an image, DNS changes) in plain numbered steps. When he reports a visual issue, ask for a screenshot rather than guessing.

**Decisions/questions**: Always ask Ben as multiple-choice questions (using the question tool), never open-ended or technical phrasing. Use plain everyday language, no jargon or code terms. Describe trade-offs in terms of what Ben will see/experience, not how it's built.

**Performance guardrail**: If Ben asks for something that would make the site slower (e.g., a large uncompressed image, an embedded widget, a big uncompressed logo, extra render-blocking scripts, a big new video file), don't just build it — tell him plainly what the slowdown would be (in terms of what a visitor would notice, not technical terms) and suggest a faster alternative that gets him the same result (e.g., a compressed/resized version, a lazy-loaded version, a lighter-weight approach). Let him choose once he knows the trade-off.

**How Ben approves changes (standing — he has asked for this more than once).** He reviews before anything is edited. Give him a numbered list where every item shows the **exact current text and the exact replacement text**, in code blocks:
- **One item per change**, individually numbered so he can answer yes/no to each. Never bundle unrelated edits into one item.
- **Quote the current text verbatim**, pulled fresh from the file — not from memory, not from earlier in the chat.
- **Recommend one option** and label it. Offer alternatives only where the choice is genuinely his (tone, wording, a real trade-off), never to avoid deciding.
- **State the measured line-count impact** on every copy change (see the no-wrap rule under "Known intentional decisions").
- **Then stop and wait.** He replies item by item ("1a good, 1b no, 2 yes…"). A "[No preference]" or a non-answer is **not** approval — say what you'd do and ask again.
- **When he asks for risks**, give per-item risk analysis plus a recommended way to minimise each, grounded in checks actually run (git log, the rendering code, the live site) rather than generic caution. On Sept 8 that turned up two facts that changed the advice entirely: the early bird prices had never actually been raised, so nobody was owed a refund; and the Live page's Sign Up button is already guarded on `isPast`, so the fix was one word instead of three edits.

## Stack (locked — do not introduce frameworks, build steps, or npm)
- GitHub Pages hosting. Plain HTML files, one shared stylesheet `css/styles.css`, vanilla JS in `js/main.js` (nav, modal, scroll reveals).
- Dynamic content (Deals, Live sessions, Agenda) lives in local data files (`js/deals-data.js`, `js/live-data.js`, `js/agenda-data.js`) that each page's script reads directly — no Google Sheets, no CSV fetching. Ben tells Claude about changes (new/updated/removed entries) in chat, and Claude edits the relevant data file and commits. See SITE_SPEC.md §6 for each file's field format.
- **`js/live-data.js` — the `recordingEmail` field (added Sept 8, 2026).** A past session can offer a **"Get Recording"** button that opens the visitor's email app with the request already written. Switch it on with one line on that session: `recordingEmail: "Ben@dentalwisdom.org",`
  - It renders in **the same place the "Sign Up" button occupies on upcoming sessions** — stacked under the sponsor logo on desktop, full width below it on a phone — at the same size (200×45px). `js/live.js` covers all three spots Sign Up can appear in (footer with sponsor text, footer without, sponsor logo column).
  - **The email writes itself** from that session's own `title`, `presenter` and `date` via `recordingMailto()` in `js/live.js`, so the message can never drift out of sync with the session. Omit the field and the session shows no button, exactly as before.
  - **Keep the label short** — it must fit one line in the 220px sponsor column. Verified fitting: `Get Recording`, `Request Link`, `Request Video`, `Recording`. Verified NOT fitting: `Request Recording`, `Watch Recording`, `Get the Recording`, `Get Recording Link`.
  - Currently set on the **Aug 27, 2026 Pearl session** only. Note the address is **Ben@**dentalwisdom.org while the rest of the site uses **info@** — that is what Ben asked for, not a typo to "fix".
  - Bump `live.js` and `live-data.js` `?v=` in `live/index.html` after editing either (currently `?v=2`).
  - **Caveat worth repeating to Ben if it comes up:** `mailto:` opens whatever mail app the device has configured. Fine on phones. A desktop visitor using webmail with no mail client set up may see nothing happen.
- **Sponsor data** (`js/sponsors-data.js`): fields are `name`, `logoUrl`, `link`, `blurb`, `tier` (platinum/gold/silver/bronze), `attending` (boolean), and `videoUrl` (optional YouTube embed URL — renders at the bottom of that sponsor's modal). Set `attending: true` on any sponsor who will have a booth/table at the conference — this shows a gold "✓ ATTENDING" pill badge on their card (top-left) and in their modal (next to the tier pill). Omit or set `false` for sponsors not physically present. **Modal media**: some sponsors will have a `videoUrl`, others will have a featured photo at the bottom of their modal instead — Ben specifies which for each sponsor. Photo support is built: optional `photoUrl` field renders a featured photo at the bottom of that sponsor's modal (Crazy Dental uses it). Optional `pending: true` shows a "Pending" pill and keeps the sponsor off the homepage logo strip. **Static sponsor buttons in page HTML** (e.g. the Live page giveaway logos) must use `data-sponsor-name="Exact Name"` (matched by name in `sponsors.js`) — never `data-sponsor-index`, which breaks silently if the data file is reordered.
- **Agenda data fields** (June 2026): `day`, `time`, `title` (use real course title, not "Lecture"; placeholders say "Lecture Title TBD"), `speaker` ("Speaker TBD" if unconfirmed), `speakerUrl` (links to `/conference-speakers#anchor`), `location`, `ce: true` (CE credit lecture), `ceCredits` (number, e.g. 1, 2, 1.5).
- **Agenda page behavior** (June 2026): defaults to **all-days view** (all days stacked, scrollable). Filter bar shows "All Days" + one button per day. Clicking a day filters to that day only; prev/next arrows appear in single-day mode. **Visual style (editorial program, updated June 2026)**: day headings are italic Playfair with a centered gold rule beneath; sessions are separated by hairlines (no card backgrounds/borders) with small-caps gold time labels in a left column and the title in Playfair to the right. CE credits show as a gold outline pill badge under the title (not a left-border highlight). Sponsor credit is its own italic gold line below the meta line. Speaker names are ink-colored links with a thin gold underline to the speakers page. Concurrent sessions render as a list indented under a left gold rule (no grid of boxed cards).
- Forms: Jotform. Direct links for registration; the floating "Join WhatsApp Group" button opens our own styled modal containing the Jotform iframe. Modal: focus-trapped, Esc closes, scroll-locked behind. **(July 2026)** The floating button + modal appear ONLY on non-conference pages (live, live-present, deals, deals-partner, whatsapp, whatsapp-policies, terms, privacy, 404) — Ben's call, to avoid competing with the Register CTA. Removed from index.html and all conference-* pages. **Lazy-loaded**: the iframe ships with `data-src` (not `src`) and no Jotform script tags in the HTML; `js/main.js` (`loadJoinForm`) swaps in the src and loads Jotform's embed handler the first time the modal opens. When adding the modal to a new page, copy the block from e.g. `deals/index.html` (keep `data-src`, never `src`).
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (body) via Google Fonts with preconnect and `display=swap`. **(July 2026)** Loaded non-render-blocking (the plain synchronous `<link rel="stylesheet">` was one of the flagged causes of slow mobile load — it blocked the very first paint). Canonical `<link>` block (use exactly this on every page):
  ```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link rel="preload" as="style" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,600;0,700;1,400&display=swap">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,600;0,700;1,400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
  <noscript><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@0,600;0,700;1,400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"></noscript>
  ```
  (Inter 800 was dropped July 2026 — audited as unused on public pages. Don't use `font-weight: 800` anywhere; heaviest available Inter weight is 700.)
- Media: optimized images in `/images` (resize to max 1600px wide, WebP ~80 quality, `loading="lazy"` below the fold). Long videos = YouTube embeds — **(July 2026)** use a click-to-load facade (thumbnail + play button; see `.video-facade` in styles.css and index.html) rather than a live `<iframe>`, so YouTube's player JS/CSS only downloads once a visitor taps play, not just from scrolling past the section. Hero = muted looping mp4 under ~8MB in `/images` with `autoplay muted loop playsinline` and a poster image; source clip per spec §4.
- **Scrolling photo/logo strips** (`.logo-scroll-wrap` / `.logo-scroll-track`, e.g. homepage Gallery and Sponsors strip): images ship with `data-src` (never `src`, never `loading="lazy"`) — `js/main.js` loads every image in a strip in one go via IntersectionObserver once the strip nears the viewport. Native `loading="lazy"` on individual images inside a continuously CSS-transform-animated strip is unreliable (the browser's lazy-load distance check uses layout position, not the animated visual position), and was the cause of photos silently failing to load on mobile. When adding a new scrolling strip or new items to one, always use `data-src`.

## Deals page — categories, ordering & sponsor sync (locked logic, July 28 2026)
This is the standing logic for the Deals page (`deals/index.html` + `js/deals-data.js`). Apply it automatically on every Deals change — Ben should never have to re-explain it. When he says "add a deal," "remove a deal," "change this description," "add a video," or "this vendor is now a sponsor / a different tier," follow these rules without asking him to restate them.

**Category order (top → bottom on the page):**
1. **Clinical & Chairside** — supplies, implants, abutments, labs, aligners, chairside/clinical AI, oral-care products dispensed to patients, clinical CE/training, scrap-metal refining.
2. **Grow Your Practice** — marketing, video, design, patient financing, revenue-cycle/collections consulting, growth analytics, case-acceptance/warranty.
3. **Run Your Practice** — back-office & practice-management software, insurance verification, payroll/HR, accounting, IT, compliance (OSHA/HIPAA), practice build-out/design, office/patient supplies, payment processing.
4. **Staffing & Recruiting** — recruiters, virtual assistants, temp/permanent placement.
5. **Money & Insurance** — practice + personal wealth management, retirement/401(k), insurance, student-loan help.
6. **Israel, Kosher & Community** — Judaica, kosher food/catering, Israel-support products, the conference hotel, kosher/dental candy.
7. **Extras** — lifestyle/personal referrals that fit nowhere above (Marcus, Wealthfront, Tesla).

Place any new deal by *what the dentist is shopping for*, using the definitions above. Do not invent new categories without Ben's OK.

**Order WITHIN each category (always):**
1. Conference sponsors first, ranked by tier: **Platinum → Gold → Silver → Bronze**.
2. Within the same tier, follow the order the sponsor appears in `js/sponsors-data.js` (that file's array order = the conference sponsors page order).
3. Non-sponsors follow, after all sponsors in that category.
Re-sort the affected category by this rule after any add/remove/tier change.

**Manual order overrides (Ben's explicit call — keep as-is, do NOT auto-sort back to the tier rule):**
- **Clinical & Chairside** (set July 28 2026): orthobrain, Crazy Dental, Emerald Dental Lab, Pearl, MB Precious Metals, Adin, TruAbutment, TheraBreath, AAFE. (This intentionally deviates from strict tier order — e.g. Crazy Dental above Emerald.) When a new sponsor is added to this category, place it and ask Ben where it should sit rather than auto-sorting.

**`js/sponsors-data.js` is the single source of truth for sponsor-level facts.** A deal is a "sponsor" iff its company has an entry there. Tier, and any sponsor video (`videoUrl`) / blurb, live in sponsors-data.js — the Deals card reads from it. Consequences to rely on (so Ben never re-explains):
- Add a company to sponsors-data.js → its deal automatically gets the tier pill and jumps to the sponsor block of its category. Remove it → pill disappears and it drops to the non-sponsor block. (e.g. Dental Processing Solutions was removed from sponsors-data.js July 28 2026 — "Credit Card Processing" stays on Deals with no pill, sorted among non-sponsors in Run Your Practice.)
- Change a sponsor's `tier` → its pill and its position re-sort automatically.
- Change a sponsor's video or description in sponsors-data.js → it updates everywhere that sponsor's detail shows (sponsor page + any Deals-card sync). Keep sponsor-level copy in sponsors-data.js, not duplicated in deals-data.js.

**Name matching** (deal title ≠ sponsor `name` in several cases — match by company):
"Dental Supplies" = "Crazy Dental" · "Credit Card Processing" = "Dental Processing Solutions" · "Apex Reimbursement Specialists" = "APEX". (The LiveWell Capital deal was renamed from "Sam Waller - LiveWell Capital" to "LiveWell Capital" on July 28 2026, so its title now matches the sponsor name directly — no alias needed.) Add new aliases here when they arise.

**Tier pill:** every deal whose company is a conference sponsor shows a small tier pill (Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze) on the card and in its detail modal, styled to the tier. Non-sponsors show no pill.

**Offer/promo display (rule for all offers, both pages):** offer text is always **bold + gold** — sponsor pop-ups use `.sponsor-modal__promo`, deal pop-ups use `.deal-offer__text` (both gold via `--color-gold-text`). On the **Deals** pop-up, an offer containing " + " splits into separate lines (one offer per line), and any line with a promo code (e.g. `(WISDOM10)`, or "code DENTAL50") gets its own **Copy code** button — so a two-code offer like Crazy Dental's "10% off First Order (WISDOM10) + Free Ground Shipping (WISDOMSHIP)" shows two lines with two Copy buttons. This is automatic in `js/deals.js` (`buildOffers` + `extractCode`); just write the promo normally and it formats itself. Future offers need no special handling. The **Sponsors page** pop-up now does the same (same `buildOffers`/`extractCode` logic in `js/sponsors.js`, reusing the `.deal-offer`/`.deal-offer__text`/`.deal-modal__copy` classes), so a multi-code sponsor offer splits into lines with Copy buttons there too. **Spacing rule:** keep a clear paragraph break between the description and the offer on BOTH pop-ups — the offer container carries the top margin that creates it (`.deal-modal__offers` on Deals, `.sponsor-modal__offers` on Sponsors, ≈`--space-md`). Don't remove that gap.

**Modal media placement (rule):** in the deal pop-up, any video renders **under** the "View Deal" button (consistent with the Sponsors page, e.g. Reach), followed by the optional flyer photo.

**Migration status (DONE July 28 2026):** the 7-category structure + tier pills are now live in the code. `deals-data.js` is re-categorized/re-ordered per this logic (Clinical & Chairside manual order); `deals.js` renders the tier pill on each sponsor deal card + modal by looking the company up in `js/sponsors-data.js` (via `SPONSOR_TIER` + `DEAL_SPONSOR_ALIAS`, parenthetical-stripping match); `deals/index.html` now loads `sponsors-data.js` before `deals.js`. The "Dental Equipment / All Practice Solutions" deal is archived as an in-file comment at the bottom of `deals-data.js` (it was never in sponsors-data.js). "Dental Processing Solutions" is archived (commented) in `sponsors-data.js`, so "Credit Card Processing" stays on Deals with no pill. Pill CSS: `.deal-tier` / `.deal-tier--{platinum,gold,silver,bronze}` in styles.css. To add a new sponsor deal: add the company to sponsors-data.js (pill appears automatically) and place the deal in deals-data.js per the ordering rules above.

## Design system
Tokens as CSS variables in `:root`. Vibe: calm luxury, warm Jewish community, premium but approachable. Generous whitespace, large Playfair headlines, soft sand/ivory section bands, sea-glass and coral accents used sparingly. Motion: subtle only — IntersectionObserver fade-up on scroll, gentle card lifts, smooth modal entrance. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Never flashy, never salesy.

**Current spacing tokens (tuned June 2026 — do not revert):**
- `--space-xl: 3.25rem` (was 4rem) — standard section top/bottom padding
- `--space-2xl: 4rem` (was 5rem) — hero, footer, large gaps
- `.section--compact` uses `var(--space-lg)` = 2.5rem (fixed — was erroneously identical to `.section`)
- `.section-heading` margin-bottom: `2rem` (was 2.5rem)
- `.sponsor-strip-section` has no extra padding-bottom (removed duplicate stacking)
- `#section-experience` (index.html): padding `1.75rem` top/bottom, bullet list max-width `860px`, item padding `0.85rem`
- `#section-cta` (index.html): padding `1.5rem`, h2 margin-bottom `1rem`, questions margin-top `0.5rem`, gold line margin-bottom `0.75rem`

## Conventions
- Header, footer, floating Join button: identical markup on every page. Primary nav has 4 items: **Conference · Live · Deals · WhatsApp**. `aria-current="page"` is set on the matching nav link for each page. Conference sub-nav (Overview • Agenda • Speakers • **Sponsors** • FAQ • Register) appears ONLY on index.html, conference-agenda/index.html, conference-speakers/index.html, conference-sponsors/index.html, conference-faq/index.html.
- Any change to a shared element must be applied to every page in the same session — grep to verify before finishing.
- Mobile-first CSS; full-screen overlay menu on mobile per spec. Test mentally at 375px and 1280px.
- **URL structure (June 2026)**: All pages use the folder/index.html pattern — no `.html` in URLs. `dentalwisdom.org/conference-agenda` serves `conference-agenda/index.html`, etc. Only `index.html` and `404.html` live at the root. Never create new `.html` files at the root; always create `new-page/index.html`.
- Speakers page (`conference-speakers/index.html`): **13 real speakers confirmed** (see below). Target ~16 cards total. Adding a speaker = copy one `<article class="speaker-card">` block and fill in the data attributes — no JS changes needed. Removing = delete that block.
- Speaker modal is **760px wide** (`max-width: 760px`) and **92vh tall** — larger than default to accommodate long bios. Both the ✕ button and clicking outside close it. Esc also closes.
- **Sponsor support in modal**: add `data-sponsor-name`, `data-sponsor-url`, `data-sponsor-logo` attributes to an article to show a logo + link at the bottom of the bio. Logos live in `images/sponsors/`. Currently wired for Sam Waller (LiveWell Capital) and Rabbi Dr. Katz (Touro).
- **No-photo-yet placeholder**: if a speaker doesn't have a headshot yet, don't point `data-photo` at a missing file (shows a broken image icon). Instead leave `data-photo=""`, add `data-initials="XX"` (their initials), and on the card use `<div class="speaker-avatar speaker-avatar--placeholder" aria-hidden="true">XX</div>` in place of the `<img class="speaker-avatar">`. The bio modal picks this up automatically (same `speakerModal` JS checks `data-photo`; if empty it shows the matching initials circle instead of a photo). Style is a light sand/white circle with dark navy initials — already built in `conference-speakers/index.html`'s `<style>` block (`.speaker-avatar--placeholder`, `.speaker-modal__avatar--placeholder`). Currently used for Dr. Samuel Schuster.

Speaker photos live in `images/speaker-*.{jpg,png,webp}`. Source bios/photos in `_Speaker Bios & Pictures - Drop Here/`. Dr. Samuel Schuster's photo is still TODO — no headshot provided yet (see placeholder note in conference-speakers/index.html). Dr. Tzvi Krupka's photo is resized and saved as `images/speaker-tzvi-krupka.webp` (790×800, ~15KB); his bio is in `_archive/conference-speakers-full.html`, the master reference for the eventual speaker cards. Dr. Gabe Hershman's old headshot was moved to `_archive/superseded-images/speakers/` (not deleted) since Krupka is replacing his Thu 2–4pm slot.

**Confirmed (session titles + speakers locked, per Ben, July 13, 2026):** Dr. Harold Katz, Dr. Daniel Greenbaum, Dr. Tzvi Krupka, Dr. Ariel Steinberger, Dr. Sara Werb, Sam Waller.

**Speaker page reorganized (July 24, 2026)** — the table above is partially stale; the LIVE `conference-speakers/index.html` is now the source of truth (it's the full published page, not `_archive/...-full.html`). See "Current live state" below for the up-to-date roster. Current state: 12 active cards, ordered chronologically by speaking time within each day. Removed (archived in-file as comments, not deleted): Dr. Craig Berry, Dr. Samuel Schuster (his agenda entry stays but no longer links to a card), Yaakov Citron (session replaced by hands-on tracks; Citron Films still a sponsor), plus Dr. Sean Ference (archived earlier). Restored: Dr. Marc Faber (Thu 6:30 PM). Dr. Nathaniel Dancykier's card is first in Friday and lists both his sessions (Fri 9:00 AM lecture + Shabbos 2:45 PM DVI). Dr. Sara Werb's card is single-session (Fri 10:30 AM–12:30 PM, NuSmile sponsor removed). Gobbie Cohn's card session reads "Kabbalas Shabbos" (Ben's wording) and sits last in Friday. **[Updated Sept 8, 2026: now 13 active cards. Dr. Craig Berry was restored to the live page, and Rabbi Dr. Ephraim Rudolph was added Sept 3, 2026. The removals listed above still stand for Sean Ference, Yaakov Citron, Samuel Schuster and Gobbie Cohn.]**

**Still-pending slots (as of July 13, 2026)** — for reference, not urgent, not blocking publish:
- Thursday 6:30–8:00 PM: FILLED (July 24, 2026) — Dr. Marc Faber, CEO of Edge Dental Management, "I Buy Junk Practices" (CE, 1.5 credits). Was previously "Concurrent Classes — Topics to Be Announced."
- Friday 3:00–5:00 PM concurrent hands-on block (updated July 24, 2026 — now 5 tracks): (1) "Straight Forward: Building Your Clear Aligner Practice" — Dr. Sam Glick, sponsored by orthobrain; (2) "Cosmetic Dentistry Hands-On Workshop" — Dr. Elaine Bylis; (3) "Hands-On Implants Workshop" — speaker TBD, sponsored by Adin; (4) "Hands-On Endodontics or Periodontics Workshop" — topic & speaker TBD (the Endo and Perio tracks were merged into one line July 24, 2026, back to 4 tracks total). All three confirmed classes are provisionally set to CE 2 (2-hour block) pending Ben's confirmation of exact credits. New speaker cards for Dr. Bylis (photo saved: images/speaker-elaine-bylis.webp) and Dr. Sam Glick (photo saved July 24, 2026: images/speaker-sam-glick.webp) added to _archive/conference-speakers-full.html.
- Friday 9:00–10:00 AM: "Practice Management Lecture" — speaker TBD
- Friday 12:30–1:30 PM: Lunch — sponsor TBD
- Friday 1:30–3:00 PM: title and speaker both TBD
- Friday 10:30 PM: "Shiur & Oneg" — speaker TBD
- Shabbos 11:00 AM: "Kiddush & Dvar Torah" — speaker TBD
- Shabbos 2:45 PM: FILLED (July 24, 2026) — "Dental Volunteers for Israel (DVI)," Dr. Nathaniel Dancykier (CE, 1). Was previously a "Dental Related Shiur to Be Announced Soon" placeholder.
- Shabbos 3:45 PM: "Making Aliyah and Practicing Dentistry in Israel" — speaker TBD
- Accessibility: semantic landmarks, alt text on every image, visible focus states, body-text contrast ≥ 4.5:1, skip-to-content link. Logo scroll strips have a keyboard pause/play button (WCAG 2.2.2) injected by `js/main.js` — skip injection when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set (CSS already stops the animation). Hero video autoplay is suppressed by JS when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
- Every page: unique `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph tags, favicon, custom 404 per spec §8.
- External services allowed: Jotform, YouTube, Google Fonts. Nothing else.

## Known intentional decisions (do not "fix" these)
- **Never let text grow from one line to two. Verify it, don't eyeball it.** Ben's rule, stated Sept 8, 2026: if a piece of text fits on one line today, it must still fit on one line after an edit. Applies to any copy change anywhere — buttons, labels, eyebrows, headings, hero notes, FAQ answers. **Guessing at this has been wrong repeatedly**, so measure it in a real browser before writing to the file, and again after:
  1. Stage the affected page(s) + `css/styles.css` into the container, serve with `python3 -m http.server`, load with Playwright (Chromium is preinstalled at `/opt/pw-browsers`; `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set — never run `playwright install`).
  2. **Wait for the real fonts**: `await page.waitForFunction(() => document.fonts.status === 'loaded')`. Fallback fonts give wrong widths.
  3. Force hidden content visible or nothing measures: open every `<details>`, and set `opacity:1; transform:none` on every `[data-reveal]`.
  4. Count **visual lines**, not height: `const r=document.createRange(); r.selectNodeContents(el); r.getClientRects().length` — one rect per rendered line.
  5. Swap `el.innerHTML` to each candidate wording, re-measure, restore.
  6. Test **320, 360, 375, 390, 414, 430, 600, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1920**. A candidate is acceptable only if it grows at **none** of them.
  - **Do not check mobile only.** Some elements are *narrower* on desktop: the homepage gold pricing box sits in a two-column grid, so it is 1 line at 375px and 3 lines at 1280px. A wording safe on a phone can add a 4th line on a laptop.
  - Real failures this caught on Sept 8, 2026, all of which looked fine by eye: `Early Bird Pricing — Extended to Sept 30` (4th line in the desktop pricing box) · `Early bird pricing extended through September 30.` (wrapped in the hero at 320px) · `...extended through Sept 30.` in the FAQ band (wrapped at 320 and 430px) · `Extended Through September 30, 2026` in the fees FAQ (+1 line at 375, 414, 430, 1024px) · `Request Recording` (2 lines in the 220px sponsor column).
  - **When a wording grows, find shorter wording** — don't ship it and don't ask Ben to accept the wrap. Every one of the above had a working alternative.
- **Time labels are always "EST"** (Ben's call, July 2026): every Live session time — and any time shown anywhere on the site — displays as "EST", e.g. "8:00 PM – 9:30 PM EST". Never use "ET" or "EDT", even for events during daylight-saving months. Ben understands "EST" is technically standard time; he wants the clock time to read as New York local time with the "EST" label used uniformly. When adding a new session to `js/live-data.js`, always write the `time` field with "EST".
- **Mobile menu focus target (`js/main.js`, `openMenu`)**: focuses the first link in `.mobile-menu__list` (e.g. "Conference"), NOT the logo link. Focusing the logo link makes the browser's gold focus ring stack on top of the logo's navy border, which looks like two nested boxes. Do not change this back to `mobileMenu.querySelector('a')`.
- **Pricing label on homepage**: The homepage pricing box and accordion say "Dental Resident" (concise). The FAQ says "Dental Student or Dental Resident" (more complete). Both are correct — this discrepancy is intentional.
- **CSS cache version**: The stylesheet currently loads as `styles.css?v=54`. Bump the version number every time you make CSS changes so returning visitors get the updated file. Use Python `os.walk()` to replace across all HTML files (the folder name has a space — never use `find | xargs sed`):
  ```python
  import os, re
  root = "/sessions/.../mnt/Dental Wisdom Site"  # use correct sandbox path
  for dp, dirs, files in os.walk(root):
      dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not d.startswith('.')]
      for fn in files:
          if not fn.endswith('.html'): continue
          p = os.path.join(dp, fn)
          txt = open(p).read()
          if 'styles.css?v=OLD' in txt:
              open(p,'w').write(txt.replace('styles.css?v=OLD','styles.css?v=NEW'))
  ```

## Color tokens (June 2026 — do not revert)
All gold values are tokenized. Never use hardcoded hex for gold colors anywhere:
- `--color-gold-warm: #B8892A` — decorative gold (borders, icons, backgrounds). Do NOT use for text on white.
- `--color-gold-dark: #9e7523` — button hover backgrounds only (e.g. `.btn-primary:hover`).
- `--color-gold-text: #8C6A1A` — all gold-colored text, including eyebrows, CTAs, links, meta labels. Passes WCAG AA (4.65:1 on white). Use this anywhere text is gold-colored at any size.
- `--color-accent` and `--color-cta` both resolve to `#B8892A` (decorative only — do not use for text).

**Rule**: if a CSS property is `color:` (text), use `--color-gold-text`. If it's a background, border, or icon fill, use `--color-gold-warm` or `--color-gold-dark`.

## Workflow rules
- One page per session, in the spec's build order. Start each session by proposing a short plan; wait for approval before writing code.
- Session 1 also builds the scaffold: folder structure, styles.css with tokens, shared header/footer/modal, and index.html.
- Commit after each approved page: `git add -A && git commit -m "Build <page>"`. Never leave a session uncommitted.
- **Change log**: `CHANGELOG.md` in the site root is a plain-English, most-recent-first list of every commit, grouped by date, so Ben can see what changed without touching git directly. After every commit (or batch of commits) in a session, append the new entries to the top of `CHANGELOG.md` before ending the session.
- Local preview: from the site folder: `cd ~/Desktop/Dental\ Wisdom\ Site && python3 -m http.server 8000`, then http://localhost:8000.
- **Terminal commands**: Always include the `cd` step so Ben can copy-paste the whole thing. Format: `cd ~/Desktop/Dental\ Wisdom\ Site && <command>`.
- Do not touch DNS, CNAME, or Squarespace until Ben explicitly starts the launch step.
- **Never delete files — archive instead.** This applies everywhere, not just content files: if something needs to be removed from active use (an old page, an image, a stray lock file, anything), move it aside (e.g. into `_archive/`, or rename with a `.bak`/timestamp suffix) rather than deleting it. Ben has said this explicitly more than once. **Reinforced Aug 26, 2026, after Claude broke this rule** — read it as absolute: no `rm`, `rm -rf`, `rmdir` or `unlink` in this folder, ever, for any reason. That includes (a) files Claude itself created by accident, (b) `.git/index.lock` / `.git/HEAD.lock` and their backup copies, (c) zero-byte or obviously-junk files Claude judges harmless. Archive instead: `mv <file> <file>.archived_$(date +%s)` for lock files, or move it into `_archive/`, then tell Ben where it went. Do not offer deletion as an option, do not ask Ben for delete permission, and if delete permission was already granted earlier in a session that is **not** license to use it. The ~119 accumulated `.git/*.lock.*` backup files are to be left alone, not cleaned up.
- **Live event slides (`liveslides/index.html`) — archive outgoing content before overwriting it.** This is a separate, self-contained slide deck for the monthly Dental Wisdom Live webinar (not the same thing as `js/live-data.js`, which is the session listing on the public `live/index.html` page — don't confuse the two). It's edited via the `DECK` object near the top of its `<script>` block — look for the in-file comment "EDIT EACH MONTH HERE." Fields: `title` (date/time), `sessionDate` (tonight's date in ISO form — drives the next-session line on slide 9), `nextSession` (leave `null` to auto-pull; set an object to override), `opener`, `dvarSpeaker`, `conference` (slide 5 promo box: `save`, `code`, `fine`, and `alert` — the pink urgency bar; set `alert:""` to hide it), `spotlight` (slide 4, the 30-second vendor ad), `lecture` (slide 6, the featured speaker), `photos` (slide 8 — ONE flat array of image paths; the three panels all draw from it at random without repeats, so just add/remove paths, don't group them), `giveaways` (slide 7, the prize wheel — each entry takes `sponsor`, `prize`, `logo`, plus **optional** `website`, `contact` (first name), `phone` and `prizePlural`; supplied ones render at the bottom of the prize card on the slide AND as one condensed gold line in the winner pop-up's navy band, and any omitted field hides its own line. `prize` stays SINGULAR — one per winner — and is what the slide and winner pop-up show; `prizePlural` is used ONLY on the title-slide billboard, where the sponsor is thanked for the whole set. Added Aug 26–27, 2026). **Two things to know (added Aug 25, 2026):** (1) the deck now loads `../js/live-data.js` so slide 9 can name the next session by itself — it picks the first `status:"upcoming"` entry with a `sortDate` after `DECK.sessionDate`, and falls back to hiding that block if the file can't be read, so don't move or rename `js/live-data.js` without checking slide 9. (2) Slide 8 is no longer a duplicate of slide 5 — it's the photo/experience slide (`.conf--photo`), so edits meant for "both conference slides" now only apply to the promo box, which appears on both. Ben tells Claude the new values in chat each month, same as other data-file updates. **Before overwriting `DECK.spotlight`, `DECK.lecture`, or `DECK.giveaways`**, copy the outgoing values (just those fields — not the whole deck/file) into `liveslides/_archive/spotlight-lecture-giveaway-history.md`, dated and labeled with the vendor/speaker name, so if that vendor or speaker comes back later their content can be pasted straight back in instead of rebuilt from scratch.

- **Live slides — the winner pop-up must FIT ON SCREEN, with margin (learned the hard way, Aug 27–28 2026).** The giveaway winner sheet overflowed during a live session: its content ran taller than the box, so `overflow:auto` kicked in and the **Close / Spin again buttons sat below an internal scrollbar**, unreachable mid-presentation. It looked fine at the one window size it was checked at.
  - **The rule:** the sheet's content height must stay at or under **~510px** in the deck's 1280x720 coordinate space. That lands it at 53–71% of viewport height across every common window shape, leaving 100px+ of visible margin top and bottom. `.sheet` is capped at `max-height:84%` as a backstop, but the cap is NOT the design target — hitting it means a scrollbar, which is the bug.
  - **Anything added to that pop-up must be paid for by removing height elsewhere.** The sponsor band is the expensive part (logo card `min-height`, band padding, the gap). When the sponsor contact line was added on Aug 26 nothing was trimmed to make room, which is what pushed it over.
  - **How to check, and don't skip it:** open the winner sheet and compare `sheet.scrollHeight` with `sheet.clientHeight` — any positive difference is the bug. Verify at several window shapes, not one: 2785x1580, 1920x1080, 1512x982, 1440x900, 1280x800, 1280x720, 1600x1200 (tall), 2560x1080 (ultrawide) and 1440x700 (short). Test a long two-line winner name too, since names wrap.
  - Same applies to the "Add names" sheet, which shares `.sheet`.

- **Live slides — the title-slide countdown billboard (`DECK.waitingRoom`, added Aug 27, 2026).** A gold "Start 2:00" button on slide 1 opens a full-screen billboard that fills the couple of minutes Ben gives people to join. It cycles panels, then a big 10-to-1 countdown, then closes itself back to the title slide. Panels in order: each **giveaway sponsor**, the **vendor spotlight**, the **conference**, the **CE partner**, **DentalWisdom.org/deals**, and **Dental Wisdom Live** (which names the real next session from `js/live-data.js`).
  - **A sponsor who is the vendor spotlight is NEVER also shown as a giveaway sponsor on the billboard.** They get one panel, headed "Tonight's Vendor Spotlight", even when they also appear in `DECK.giveaways` (Alphaeon was both in Aug 2026). This is automatic: `wrSponsors()` drops any giveaway sponsor whose name matches `waitingRoom.spotlight.name`. **The match is on the name string**, so when adding a sponsor to both places spell the name identically in `giveaways[].sponsor` and `waitingRoom.spotlight.name` — otherwise they'll be listed twice. The giveaway slide itself is unaffected: they still appear in its dropdown as normal.
  - **Timing is by TOTAL, not per panel.** `totalSeconds` (120) is fixed and the panels split whatever is left after `countFrom` (10) seconds of closing countdown — so adding or removing a sponsor changes each panel's turn, never the overall length. Don't reintroduce a per-panel seconds setting; it makes the total drift off a clean 2:00. The finale lasts exactly `countFrom` seconds so it never pauses on a number.
  - **`waitingRoom.about`** holds the plain-English "what this sponsor does" lines, keyed by sponsor name, with an optional smaller `detail`. Sponsors missing from that list simply get no line.
  - **Panels build in top-to-bottom over ~3s** via `nth-child` transition delays on `.wr-pane.on > *`. Sponsor panels run to 8 rows — if a row is ever added, extend those delays too, or the new row (having no delay) animates FIRST. Also: never name a variable `n` inside `paint()`; it shadows the panel count and silently blanks every panel.
  - **Music is supported but no track is set** (`music: ""`). `liveslides/audio/` is gitignored apart from its README, so audio files stay on Ben's Mac and are never published — playing a track on a call is fine, hosting it on the site is distribution. Any track that IS published must be one Ben holds rights to.
- **File flow**: All changes go to the local Desktop folder (`/Users/dr.lisa/Desktop/Dental Wisdom Site`) first and are committed locally. Never push to GitHub — Ben pushes manually when ready with `git push origin main`. Never instruct or trigger a push; just remind Ben to push after a session if he wants GitHub updated.
- **Git lock files on this mount**: `git add`/`git commit` in this folder often print `warning: unable to unlink '.git/index.lock' (or HEAD.lock, or objects/.../tmp_obj_*): Operation not permitted`, and a stale `.git/index.lock` or `.git/HEAD.lock` can make the next command fail with "Another git process seems to be running." This is a quirk of this mounted folder (deleting files here needs explicit approval that the warnings don't trigger) — it is NOT data loss and NOT a real concurrent git process. Fix: `mv` the stale lock file to a throwaway name instead of `rm` (e.g. `mv .git/index.lock .git/index.lock.bak_$(date +%s)`), then retry the git command. A commit that prints "[main <hash>] <message>" with a "files changed" line DID succeed even if unlink warnings appeared above it — check `git log --oneline -1` to confirm rather than assuming it failed.
- **A push landed but the site didn't update (happened Aug 26, 2026 — first time)**: symptoms were Ben pushes successfully, `git fetch` confirms `origin/main` has the commit, `raw.githubusercontent.com/DentalWisdom/dentalwisdom.github.io/main/<file>` serves the new content — and yet dentalwisdom.org keeps serving the *previous* deploy, with any brand-new file path returning 404. Cause that time: GitHub had an open incident (opened 15:09 UTC, push was 15:35 UTC) and simply never queued a `pages-build-deployment` run for the push. The commit arrived; the build trigger didn't fire. Repo config, DNS and the push were all correct the whole time — nothing in this repo caused it and nothing in this repo could fix it.
  - **Fastest test for "did the deploy actually publish?"** Load a file path that exists *only* in the new commit (e.g. a logo added in that commit). 404 = no new build has published. This is server-side — a browser hard-refresh proves nothing either way, so don't send Ben chasing browser cache. Only once the file loads is it worth telling him to hard-refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`) to clear his own cached copy.
  - **Diagnosis order**: (1) the new-file-path test above; (2) `github.com/DentalWisdom/dentalwisdom.github.io/deployments` — shows whether a build was attempted at all and whether it succeeded or failed; (3) Settings → Pages — should read Source = "Deploy from a branch", branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`, plus "DNS check successful".
  - **Fix that worked**: push again. An empty commit is enough — `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages rebuild"` — then Ben runs `__Push to GitHub.command`. Build fired and published within about 3 minutes.
  - **Do NOT touch the Pages source to force a rebuild.** The Save button on Settings → Pages only activates when a value changes, and the tempting workaround (switch folder to `/docs`, save, switch back) would publish from a folder that doesn't exist here — that can build an empty site and take dentalwisdom.org down. A correct config is never the problem in this situation; another push is always the safe trigger.
  - **The Actions tab is unreliable for this.** Filtered to `workflow:pages-build-deployment` it showed no runs after Jul 30 while the Deployments page listed builds #236–#241 through Aug 14. Trust `/deployments`, not the filtered Actions list.
  - **Pushes cannot be run from the Claude session shell** — it has no GitHub credentials (no helper, no token, no SSH key, no keychain access), so `git push` there fails with "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'". Ben always pushes himself with `__Push to GitHub.command`. Committing from the session shell works fine.
- **Don't mistake the liveslides placeholder for a broken deploy.** Fetching `dentalwisdom.org/liveslides/` as raw HTML shows `Thursday, June 18` and no speaker name, because line ~406 holds `<span id="t-date">Thursday, June 18</span>` as static placeholder text and the real values live in the `DECK` object further down (`title.date`, `lecture.doctor`) and are injected by JavaScript at runtime. Any tool that reads HTML without executing scripts will report the stale placeholder. Verify the deck by grepping the local file for the `DECK` values, or open it in a real browser — never by reading the fetched HTML text.
- **After every fix, say it out loud**: explicitly tell Ben "this is saved locally but won't show on dentalwisdom.org or dentalwisdom.github.io until you push" — every time, not just once. If Ben reports a bug "still happening" right after a fix, check first whether he's looking at the live published site (uncommitted-but-unpushed fixes never show there) vs. the local preview (`localhost:8000`) — ask which one he's checking before assuming the fix failed.

## Saving tokens / chat length
- Long chats use up more of Ben's usage budget as they go (everything said so far gets re-read each turn). To keep this efficient, tell Ben when it's a good moment to start a fresh chat — right after a page is finished and committed, or after a big batch of edits is wrapped up and confirmed.
- When suggesting this, say it plainly, e.g.: "Good stopping point — feel free to start a new chat for the next page (live.html). I'll pick up context from CLAUDE.md, SITE_SPEC.md, and git history."
- Don't suggest it mid-task or before a commit — only at clean breakpoints.

## Definition of done (per page)
Spec copy verbatim; looks right at 375px and 1280px; nav, footer, and Join modal work; all links wired or marked TODO; images lazy-loaded with alt text; no console errors; committed.
