   Dental Wisdom Live — session data
   This is the single source of truth for the Live page.
   No Google Sheet is used — Ben tells Claude about changes
   (new session, updated info, status change) and Claude
   edits this file directly and commits.

   Fields per session:
     title        - Session title (required)
     date         - Display date, e.g. "May 14, 2026"
     time         - Display time, e.g. "8:00 PM – 9:30 PM EST"
                    (always label times "EST" — never "ET" or "EDT")
     presenter    - Presenter name
     description  - Full session description
     perk         - UPCOMING sessions: italic gold highlight line under
                    the description. If omitted, upcoming sessions default
                    to "Register and attend to earn CE credit." Set this
                    only to override that (e.g. the Pearl free-month line).
     pastPerk     - PAST sessions show NO perk line by default. Set this
                    to show one on a specific past session (e.g. Pearl once
                    it's over: "Request the recording to earn CE credit.").
     pastPerkLink - Optional URL that makes the pastPerk line a link
                    (e.g. the recording-request form). Only used with pastPerk.
     registerLink - Registration URL
     sponsor      - Sponsor display name
     sponsorLink  - Sponsor website URL
     sortDate     - ISO date for sorting, e.g. "2026-05-14"

    presenter: "Saul Kaplan",

Presented by Crown Catapult, this session demystifies dental exit planning: when to start, how to position your practice for its best possible valuation, and what today's market actually looks like for sellers.\n\nWhether you're years from an exit or actively weighing your options, you'll leave with a clearer picture of the paths available — from traditional sales to DSOs to newer models many practice owners don't yet know exist.\n\nTopics include when to start planning your exit, what you can do now to secure the best valuation, the current state of the market, the pros and cons of selling to a DSO, and new models you may not be aware of. Relevant for all members of the community. 1 CE credit.",
