/* =========================================================
   Dental Wisdom Conference — Sponsor cards
   Powers the clickable sponsor cards (with pop-up details) on
   conference-sponsors.html and at the bottom of
   conference-agenda.html. No Google Sheet — Ben tells Claude about
   sponsor changes (add/remove/update) and Claude edits
   this file directly.

   Fields per sponsor:
     name    - Sponsor name (required; used as the card caption,
               the pop-up heading, and image alt text)
     logoUrl - Path to the logo image in images/deals/ or
               images/sponsors/ (leave "" to show the name in a
               plain box instead of a logo)
     link    - Optional website URL (adds a "Visit website"
               button inside the pop-up; leave "" to hide it)
     blurb   - 1-2 sentence description shown inside the pop-up
     tier    - Sponsorship level, one of: "platinum", "gold",
               "silver", "bronze". Controls which tier the sponsor
               appears under on the Sponsors page (higher tiers are
               shown larger). Anything unrecognized falls to the
               bottom group. The Agenda page ignores tiers and
               shows everyone together.
