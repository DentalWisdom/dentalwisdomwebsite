   Dental Wisdom Conference — Agenda data
   See SITE_SPEC.md §6. Ben tells Claude about schedule
   changes (new session, updated time/speaker/room, etc.)
   and Claude edits this file directly. No Google Sheet.

   Fields per agenda item:
     day        - Day label shown on the agenda filter bar
     time       - Time range shown on the schedule
     title      - Session / activity name
     speaker    - Presenter or leader (optional — leave "" if none)
     speakerUrl - Link to speaker's profile page (optional)
     location   - Room or area name (optional — leave "" if not set)
     ce         - true for CE credit lectures (adds visual highlight)
     sponsor / sponsorUrl / sponsorLabel
                - Optional. Shows "Sponsored by <name>" (or a custom
                  sponsorLabel) on the card, linked to sponsorUrl. Also
                  works inside a concurrent block (applies to that one
                  card, covering its whole time block).
     sponsors   - Optional. Use instead of sponsor/sponsorUrl when two
                  or more sponsors share credit on one card, e.g.
                  [{ name: "A", url: "/conference-sponsors" },
                   { name: "B", url: "/conference-sponsors" }].
                  Each name is its own hyperlink; the joining "&" is
                  plain text, not a link. sponsorLabel still applies.
     parts      - Optional, only used on a card inside a concurrent
                  block. For a single room's slot that's really a
                  back-to-back multi-lecture session with different
                  speakers (e.g. one 2-hour block split into two
                  1-hour lectures). Array of { title, speaker,
                  speakerUrl } — each lecture title gets its own line,
                  and all the speakers are rolled into the one shared
                  meta line below (with location and sponsor, if any)
                  exactly like every other agenda card.
                  When present, the item's top-level title/speaker are
                  ignored; sponsor/sponsorUrl still cover the card.
                  See the Friday "Built to Scale" item below.

   Lecture sessions without a confirmed speaker show "Speaker TBD".
   Remaining lecture topics/speakers are still TBD and will be
   filled in as they're confirmed.

   Locations: Library (Daf Yomi Shiur, Shacharis), Shul (Lectures,
   Welcoming Remarks, Davening, Dvar Torah, Kiddush, Mincha/Maariv,
   Shalosh Seudos, Oneg), OVO at The Altair (Breakfast, Lunches,
   Shabbos Dinner), Atrium (Registration, Welcome Event, Welcome Party,
   Closing Party).
