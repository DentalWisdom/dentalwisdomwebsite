**Conference Sub-Navigation** (conference pages only — `index.html`, `agenda.html`, `speakers.html`, `faq.html`):
A slim secondary bar under the main header: Overview • Agenda • Speakers • FAQ • **Register** (accent button). It appears only within the conference section, so Live, Deals, and Giving stay uncluttered.

---

## 2. Tech Stack & Design Decisions (Locked)

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free)
- **Framework**: Clean HTML + one shared custom stylesheet (`css/styles.css`, design tokens as CSS variables) + vanilla JavaScript. *(Changed from Tailwind CDN: the CDN build is a runtime script not recommended for production; a hand-written stylesheet is faster, avoids flash-of-unstyled-content, and is easier to maintain. Identical visual result.)*
- **Dynamic Content**: Google Sheets published as public CSV + Papa Parse (Deals, Live CE, Agenda)
- **Forms**: Jotform (direct links + floating Join modal)
- **Images**: Hosted in GitHub repo `/images` folder (optimized). Total recommended: **25–35 images** across the entire site for premium feel without heavy loading.
- **Logo**: Clean text + tooth icon placeholder for v1 (easy to swap)
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (body) — generous, luxurious spacing and letter-spacing
- **Palette (proposed — tune once in Session 1, then freeze)**: ivory `#FBF9F4` page background • sand `#F1ECE2` alternate sections • ink `#1E2A38` text • sea-glass teal `#2F7E76` primary accent • warm coral `#D2603A` CTAs • soft gold `#D9A441` highlights • muted slate `#5C6670` secondary text
- **Animations**: Subtle only (fade-ins on scroll, gentle card lifts, smooth modal entrance). Never flashy.
- **Performance**: Optimized (lazy loading, reasonable image count, clean code)
- **Mobile Menu**: Clean full-screen overlay (premium default)
- **Background Texture**: Very subtle soft texture on some sections for premium, non-flat feel
- **Gallery Carousel**: Premium quality with smooth drag/swipe + momentum + subtle captions (user-controlled, not auto-advance)

---

## 3. Persistent Elements (on every page)

- Top navigation
- **Floating “Join the Network” button** (bottom-right, visible on all pages)
  - Clearly states: **“For Dentists Only”**
  - Opens modal with Jotform (you will build)
  - Uses the approved “For Dentists Only” messaging
- Consistent footer with Accessibility link

---

## 4. Main Conference Page (`index.html`) – Exact Flow & Text

### Hero Section
- **Background**: Full-bleed elegant looping aerial/drone beach video (muted, calm, golden hour feel)
  - **Recommended Video**: [Pexels – Calm Aerial Beach at Golden Hour](https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-view-of-a-beach-at-sunset-854251/) (or similar high-quality slow drone shot over turquoise water). Silent/muted.
- **Exact Text** (broken into clean lines):
  ```

## 11. First-Time Attendee FAQ Item (Drafted)

**What should I expect as a first-time attendee?**  
The Dental Wisdom Conference is intentionally intimate, warm, and unhurried. Expect high-quality cross-specialty lectures and hands-on education in a relaxed atmosphere with built-in time for reflection and genuine connection with colleagues. The event includes beautiful minyanim, inspiring shiurim, glatt kosher meals, and uplifting Shabbos programming. Many attendees bring their spouses and children. The overall vibe is professional yet welcoming and community-oriented — designed for both professional growth and personal rejuvenation in a warm Jewish environment.

---

**What happens after I register?**  
After you complete your registration, you will receive an immediate receipt and confirmation email. If you selected hotel accommodations during registration, you will receive a separate email from The Altair Hotel to finalize your room booking. As the conference approaches, you will receive additional communications with important details, including how to optionally reserve Shabbos meals for you and your family.

---

## 13. Build Process (Claude Code — Sequential)

1. All building happens in **Claude Code** (Claude Desktop → Code tab) inside a GitHub repo created on day one — no copy-pasting HTML out of a chat. Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` and this spec at the start of every session.
2. **One page per session**, in the build order above. Each session: short plan → build → Ben previews in the browser → tweaks → commit.
3. We only move to the next page after Ben confirms the previous one (unchanged from v1).
4. Shared elements (header, conference sub-nav, footer, Join modal, `styles.css`) are built once in Session 1 and reused everywhere; any later change to a shared element is applied to every page in that same session.
5. Launch: swap placeholders for real content, mobile QA pass, enable GitHub Pages, point the domain’s DNS at it (Google Workspace MX records stay untouched), retire Squarespace.

---

**This document is now complete and ready.**

All major decisions are locked. All drafted content is included. All supporting materials (Google Sheet templates, Image Asset List, placeholder speakers structure, video recommendation) are specified.

**Next Step**  
1. Resolve the Open Items below (one short message is enough).
2. Phase 1 setup (~1 hour): create the GitHub repo, install Claude Desktop and open the Code tab, put `CLAUDE.md` + this spec in the project folder, and add `/content` (pasted page copy) and `/images-source` (flyer + photos).
3. First Claude Code prompt: **“Read CLAUDE.md and SITE_SPEC.md, propose a plan for index.html, then build it.”**

---

## Open Items

1. **Date phrasing**: hero says “March 3–6, 2027”; other 2027 materials say “March 3–7”. Pick one site-wide.
2. **dentalwisdomconference.com**: should it redirect to the new site at launch?
3. **Design lock**: fonts + vibe match the light “calm luxury” mockup direction. Confirm, or ask to see the dark-luxe alternative before Session 1.
4. **Ben’s pre-build to-dos**: build the Join-the-Network Jotform; create + publish the 3 Google Sheets and paste the CSV URLs into §6; gather the flyer JPG and 25–35 photos into `/images-source`; paste the full Sponsor Q&A, Lecture Q&A, FAQ, and Terms text into `/content` (this spec references that copy but does not contain it).
